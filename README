NAME
    Lutherie::FretCalc

SYNOPSIS
    use Lutherie::FretCalc;

    my $fretcalc = Lutherie::FretCalc->new($scale_length);
    $fretcalc->in_units('in');
    $fretcalc->out_units('in');
    my $fret = $fretcalc->fret($fret_num);
    my @chart = fretcalc($num_frets);

CONSTRUCTOR

    new ( SCALE_LENGTH );

    This is the constructor for a new Lutherie:FretCalc object. SCALE_LENGTH
    is the numeric value for the scale length to be used for the calculation.
    The unit can be set with the in_units() and out_units() methods. 
    The default is 'in' (inches).

METHODS

    scale ( [ SCALE_LENGTH ] )

    If SCALE_LENGTH is passed, this method will set the scale length. 
    The default value is 25. The scale length is returned. 

    num_frets ( [ NUM_FRETS ] )

    If NUM_FRETS is passed, this method will set the number of frets.  
    The default value is 24. The number of frets is returned.

    fret_num ( [ FRET_NUM ] )

    If FRET_NUM is passed, this method will set the fret number.
    The default value is 12. The fret number is returned.

    in_units ( [ IN_UNITS ] )

    If IN_UNITS is passed, this method will set the in units.
    The default is 'in' (inches). The in unit is returned.
    'in' - Inches, 'mm' - Millimeters

    out_units ( [ OUT_UNITS ] )

    If OUT_UNITS is passed, this method will set the out units.
    The default is 'in' (inches). The out unit is returned.
    'in' - Inches, 'mm' - Millimeters

    calc_method ( [ CALC_METHOD ] )

    If CALC_METHOD is passed, this method will set the calc method.
    The default is 't' (tempered). The calc method is returned.
    't': tempered - power of $i/$tet (default),
    'ec': classic - 17.817,
    'es': Sloane - 17.835,
    'ep': Primative - 18

    tet ( [ TET ] )

    If TET is passed, this method will set the tones per ocatave.
    The default is 12. The number of tones per ocatave is returned.
    This value is only valid when using calc_method = 't'.

    fret ( [ FRET_NUM ] )

    Calculate the distance from the nut to the fret number. 

    fretcalc ( [ NUM_FRETS ] )

    Calculate fret locations for given scale length, number of frets, calc type
    and tet.
