NAME
    Lutherie::FretCalc

SYNOPSIS
    use Lutherie::FretCalc;

    my $fretcalc = Lutherie::FretCalc->new($scale_length);
    $fretcalc->in_units('in');
    $fretcalc->out_units('in');
    my $fret = $fretcalc->fret($fret_num);
    my @chart = $fretcalc->fretcalc($num_frets);

CONSTRUCTOR

    new ( [SCALE_LENGTH[, NUM_FRETS]] );

    This is the constructor for a new Lutherie::FretCalc object. SCALE_LENGTH
    is the numeric value for the scale length to be used for the calculation.
    The default value for scale length is 25.
    NUM_FRETS is the number of frets to be calculated.
    The default value for num_frets is 24.
    The unit can be set with the in_units() and out_units() methods. 
    The default is 'in' (inches).

METHODS

    scale ( [ SCALE_LENGTH ] )

    If SCALE_LENGTH is passed, this method will set the scale length. 
    The default value is 25. The scale length is returned. 

    num_frets ( [ NUM_FRETS ] )

    If NUM_FRETS is passed, this method will set the number of frets.  
    The default value is 24. The number of frets is returned.

    fret_num ( [ FRET_NUM ] )

    If FRET_NUM is passed, this method will set the fret number.
    The default value is 12. The fret number is returned.

    in_units ( [ IN_UNITS ] )

    If IN_UNITS is passed, this method will set the in units.
    The default is 'in' (inches). The in unit is returned.
    'in' - Inches, 'mm' - Millimeters

    out_units ( [ OUT_UNITS ] )

    If OUT_UNITS is passed, this method will set the out units.
    The default is 'in' (inches). The out unit is returned.
    'in' - Inches, 'mm' - Millimeters

    calc_method ( [ CALC_METHOD ] )

    If CALC_METHOD is passed, this method will set the calc method.
    The default is 't' (tempered). The calc method is returned.
    't': tempered - power of $i/$tet (default),
    'ec': classic - 17.817,
    'es': Sloane - 17.835,
    'ep': Primative - 18

    tet ( [ TET ] )

    If TET is passed, this method will set the tones per octave.
    The default is 12. The number of tones per octave is returned.
    This value is only valid when using calc_method = 't'.

    precision ( [ PRECISION ] )

    If PRECISION is passed, this method will set the precision of
    the displayed calculations. The default is 4 for 'in' and
    1 for 'mm'. The precision is returned.
    0: "%8.0f"
    1: "%8.1f"
    2: "%8.2f"
    3: "%8.3f"
    4: "%8.4f"
    5: "%8.5f"
    6: "%8.6f"

    half_fret ( [ FRET_NUM ] )
        If FRET_NUM is passed, this method will calculate
        the half fret for this fret number. Valid values are
        1, 6, 8 and 13. Only used with dulc_calc().
        A comma separated list of half frets is returned.

    fret ( [ FRET_NUM ] )

    Calculate the distance from the nut to the fret number. 
    A scalar containing fret location for FRET_NUM is returned.

    fretcalc ( [ NUM_FRETS ] )

    Calculate fret locations for given scale length, number of frets, calc type
    and tet. An ordered array containing fret locations from 1 to NUM_FRETS 
    is returned.

    dulc_calc ( )
        Calculate fret locations for mountain dulcimer. Number
        of frets is set at :w14. Half frets may be added by 
        using half_fret() function. Valid half frets are 1+,
        6+, 8+ and 13+. num_frets() will be ignored when using
        dulc_calc(). A hash containing fret locations from 1 to 14
        is returned.

    routines you would like to contribute.
