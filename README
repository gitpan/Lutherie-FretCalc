NAME
    Lutherie::FretCalc

DESCRIPTION
    Lutherie::FretCalc provides two routines for calculating 
    fret spacing locations for stringed musical instruments.

    fret() will find the distance for the nut for a given fret number.

    fretcalc() will generate an array containing the fret locations
    for a given number of frets.

    $scale_length is the numeric scale length
    $fret_num is the fret number being calculated (fret() only)
    $num_frets is the number of frets to be calculated (fretcalc() only)
    $input_scale is the scale to be used for the input (Scale length):
    'in' (inches) or 'mm' (millimeters)
    $output_scale if the scale to be used when dipslaying the calculations:
    'in' (inches) or 'mm' (millimeters)

    Please let me know of any bugs you find or if you have any other
    routines you would like to contribute.
