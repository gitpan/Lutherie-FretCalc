README for Lutherie::FretCalc

Lutherie::FretCalc provides two routines for calculating 
fret spacing locations for stringed musical instruments.
fret() will find the distance for the nut for a given
fret number. fretcalc() will generate an array containing
the fret locations for a given number of frets.

$scale_length is the numeric scale length
$fret_num is the fret number being calculated (C<fret> only)
$num_frets is the number of frets to be calculated (C<fretcalc> only)
$input_scale is the scale to be used for the input (Scale length):
'in' (inches) or 'mm' (millimeters)
$output_scale if the scale to be used when dipslaying the calculations:
'in' (inches) or 'mm' (millimeters)

Please let me know of any bugs you find or if you have any other
routines you would like to contribute.
